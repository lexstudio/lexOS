Well lexOS is the next gen Operating System

LexOS is written in rust but if i do my own programing language i will rewrite it in it
LexOS is as fast as possible using memory blocks at their max with a custom memory blocks handler (named u or i)

Minkernel is the kernel that runs this OS its preatty stable but in general it is made for maximum speed
Minkernel has an editing tool build into it so you dont need to know how kernels work just to change some things up (but if you want to make custom things then you need to do it)
LexOS is more like the user interface for Minkernel

LexOS goals:

-run on real hardware (*)
-networking (*)
-run as fast as possible (*)
-compile rust and c code using gcc and rustc (*)
-run a window manager ()
-have colours ()
-many apps ()


LexOS is made for those people who want a stable and fast OS that they can they build their own and very custom OS in rust without the need of knowing 1000000 files like in linux or other big OS-es
