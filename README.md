The purpose of lexOS is to be a fast, minimal, and efficient operating system specifically designed to run one powerful application at a time. It’s built from the ground up, focusing on performance, customizability, and full control over the system’s resources.

Key Goals of lexOS:

1. Kernel (minkernel):
The core of lexOS is extremely lightweight, handling tasks like memory management, CPU control, and hardware interaction.


2. One App Focus:
Unlike traditional OSes that run multiple apps, lexOS is designed to allocate all system resources to a single application, making it ideal for specialized tasks like:

High-performance computing

Embedded systems

Dedicated server applications

Real-time processing tasks



3. Customizability:
Users can configure buffer sizes, memory settings, and CPU core usage to match the specific needs of the application. It even supports choosing between signed (i) and unsigned (u) data types for performance tuning.


4. Language Support:

Originally written in Rust, with support for applications written in C, Python, and potentially V or L (the user's custom language).

Future extensions allow users to build kernel-level tools and apps.



5. Performance Optimization:
lexOS is built to outperform traditional OSes like Linux in specific benchmarks by focusing only on what’s necessary for a single app, removing unnecessary overhead.


6. Target Devices:

Can run on PCs, Raspberry Pi, and ARM-based laptops.

Designed to be portable across architectures, with a custom VM (Lexium) for ARM-to-x86 translation.




lexOS is for developers who want maximum control and efficiency when running dedicated systems or high-performance apps. It's about stripping away general-purpose bloat and giving full power to one app.
